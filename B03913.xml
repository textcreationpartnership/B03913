            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>Yes, there is a man in <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>and <hi>Johnny Armſtrong</hi> they do him call,</l>
               <l>He has no lands nor rents coming in,</l>

               <l>He has horſe and harneſs for them all,</l>

               <l>With their godly belts about their necks,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The King writes a loving letter,</l>
               <l>and with his own hand ſo tenderly;</l>
               <l>And hath ſent it unto <hi>Johnny Armſtrong,</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When <hi>John</hi> he looked this letter upon,</l>
               <l>good Lord he lookt as blith as a bird in a trée</l>
               <l>I was never before a King in my life,</l>
               <l>my father, my grand-father, nor none of us three:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ſeeing we muſt ge before the King,</l>
               <l>Lord, we will goe moſt gallantly;</l>
               <l>Ye ſhall every one have a velvet-coat</l>
               <l>laid down with golden laces three,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ye ſhall every one have a ſcarlet cloak</l>
               <l>laid down with ſilver laces five,</l>
               <l>With your golden belts about your necks;</l>
               <l>with hats and brave feathers all alike.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when <hi>John</hi> he went from <hi>Giltknock-hall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>the wind it blew hard, &amp; full faſt it did rain,</l>
               <l>Now fare thee well thou <hi>Giltknock-hall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I fear I ſhall never ſee thee again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now <hi>Johnny</hi> is to <hi>Edenborough</hi> gone,</l>
               <l>with his eightſcore men ſo gallantly,</l>
               <l>And every one of them on a milk-white ſteed,</l>
               <l>with their bucklers and ſwords hanging to their knee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when <hi>John</hi> came the King before,</l>
               <l>with his eightſcore men ſo gallant to ſee,</l>
               <l>The King he mov'd his bonnet to him,</l>
               <l>he thought he had been a King as well as he.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O pardon, pardon, my Soveraign Leige,</l>
               <l>pardon for my eightſcore man and me,</l>
               <l>For my name it is <hi>Johnny Armſtrong,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>and a ſubject of yours, my Leige, ſaid he.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Away with thee, thou falſe traytor,</l>
               <l>no pardon will I grant to thee,</l>
               <l>But to morrow morning by eight of the clock</l>
               <l>I will hang up thy eightſcore men and thee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <hi>Jonny</hi> lookt over his left ſhoulder,</l>
               <l>and to his merry men thus ſaid he;</l>
               <l>I have asked grace of a graceleſs face,</l>
               <l>no pardon there is for you or me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <hi>John</hi> pull'd out his nut-brown ſword,</l>
               <l>and it was made of mettle ſo free,</l>
               <l>Had not the King mov'd his foot as he did,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>John</hi> had taken his head from his fair body.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come follow me my merry men all,</l>
               <l>we will ſcorn one foot for to flye;</l>
               <l>It ſhall ne'v be ſaid we were hung like dogs,</l>
               <l>we will fight it out ſo manfully.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then they fought on like champions bold,</l>
               <l>for their hearts were ſturdy, ſtout and free,</l>
               <l>Till they had killed all the King's good guard</l>
               <l>there was none left alive but two or three.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But then roſe up all <hi>Edenboroguh,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>they roſe up by thouſands three,</l>
               <l>A cowardly <hi>Scot</hi> came <hi>John</hi> behind,</l>
               <l>and run him thorow the fair body.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Said <hi>John,</hi> Fight on my merry men all</l>
               <l>I am a little wounded but am not ſlain,</l>
               <l>I will lay me down for to bleed a while,</l>
               <l>then I'll riſe and fight with you again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then they fought on like mad men all,</l>
               <l>till many a man lay dead upon the plain,</l>
               <l>For they were reſolved before they would yeild,</l>
               <l>that every man would there be ſlain:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So there they fought couragiouſly,</l>
               <l>till moſt of them lay dead there and ſlain,</l>
               <l>But little <hi>Muſgrove</hi> that was his foot-page,</l>
               <l>with his bonny griſſel got away untain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when he came to <hi>Guiltknock-hall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>the Lady ſpied him preſently,</l>
               <l>A What news, what news, thou little foot-page,</l>
               <l>what news from thy Maſter and his company</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My news is bad, Lady he ſaid,</l>
               <l>which I do bring, as you may ſee;</l>
               <l>My Maſter <hi>Johnny Armſtrong</hi> is ſlain,</l>
               <l>and all his gallant company.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet thou art welcome home my bonny Griſſel,</l>
